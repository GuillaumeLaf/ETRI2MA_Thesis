[1996] von Sachs and Schneider - Wavelet smoothing of evolutionary spectra by nonlinear thresholding.md

They use a 2nd wavelet orthogonal decomposition for smoothing thr time dependent spectra of a locally stationary TS. They note the superiority of the non linear thre cholding over the linear one especially for functions of bounded variation.

The main idea for the thresholding is andysing the properties of the wavelet wefficients and find an inequality bound.

The smoothness of 'A" restricts the departure from stationarity.

The smoothness assumption allows the spectrum to be uniquely defined in the non-stationary case.



The main advantage of using nonlinear wavelet thre sholding comes from the fact that wavelets can represent spasely curves with inhomogeneais regularities

The universal threshold has to be proportional to the standard deviation of the empirical coefficients.

they need a differentiable wavelet for their smoothing.

They give the universal thresholding constant for wavelet the sholding.



The log-periodogram has better properties it is mon stable and Tends asymptotically to a normal
