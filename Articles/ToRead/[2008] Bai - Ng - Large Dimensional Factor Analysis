[2008] Bai - Ng - Large Dimensional Factor Analysis

Huge survey about Large factor analysis : 
+ estimate number of factors
+ inference when factors used in regression
+ test : unit root, common trend, panel cointegration, ...

Focus on static factors model but still makes the distinction with (generalized) dynamic FM.

At the beginning the simplest models were studied (Anderson - 1984) (Anderson & Rubin - 1956) (Lawley & Maxwell - 1971) : 
+ factors and errors assumed serially and cross-sectionally uncorrelated.
+ **N fixed and T tends to inf.
+ factors and errors are normally distributed.

"[An] important characteristic of a static model with **r factors is that the largest **r population eigenvalues of Sigma increase with **N, while the remaining eigenvalues of Sigma, as well as all eigenvalues of Omega, are bounded
