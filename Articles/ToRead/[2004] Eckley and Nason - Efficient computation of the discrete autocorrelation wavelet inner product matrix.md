[2004] Eckley and Nason - Efficient computation of the discrete autocorrelation wavelet inner product matrix

This article describe anmethod to efficiently compute the correction matrix for the LSW model by using the properties of the autocorrelation wavelets.

The remind the importance of the correction which allow to correct for the scattered spectral power which blurr the estimate.

The algorithm discrebed here builds upon the scale recursive formula for discrete wavelets.

The autocorrelation wavelet has several properties : compactly supported, symmetric at 0, positive definite function.

The authors divide the construction of the matrix by diagonals.
