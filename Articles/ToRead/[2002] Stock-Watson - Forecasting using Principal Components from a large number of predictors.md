Stock and Watson (2002) : Forecasting using principal components from a large number of predictors

This article treats the forecasting of a single time series with help of factor models to enhance forecast precision. The basic idea is to estimate common factors and to run a linear regression with the desired time series and those factors. 
It also proves the convergence of estimated factors to the true common factors. 
This convergence also holds true under time-varying assumptions of factor loadings.
