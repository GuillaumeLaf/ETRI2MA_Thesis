[2015] Gibberd and Nelson - Estimating Multi-resolution dependency graphs within the locally stationary wavelet framework.md

Try to sparsly model the dependency structure in the multivariate setting.

They use the multivariate LSW model introduced by Park et al. (2014). 
All the dependencies are summed up in the matrix of wavelet coefficients. The idiosyncratic increments are considered independent of scale, time and cross-section (they are truly idiosyncratic).
