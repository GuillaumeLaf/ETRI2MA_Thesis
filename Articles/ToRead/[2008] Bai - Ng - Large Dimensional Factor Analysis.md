[2008] Bai - Ng - Large Dimensional Factor Analysis

Huge survey about Large factor analysis : 
+ estimate number of factors
+ inference when factors used in regression
+ test : unit root, common trend, panel cointegration, ...

Focus on static factors model but still makes the distinction with (generalized) dynamic FM.

At the beginning the simplest models were studied (Anderson - 1984) (Anderson & Rubin - 1956) (Lawley & Maxwell - 1971) : 
+ factors and errors assumed serially and cross-sectionally uncorrelated.
+ *N* fixed and T tends to inf.
+ factors and errors are normally distributed.

"[An] important characteristic of a static model with *r* factors is that the largest *r* population eigenvalues of Sigma increase with *N*, while the remaining eigenvalues of Sigma, as well as all eigenvalues of Omega, are bounded".

"Large" dimensional -> sample size N and T tends to inf. in the asymptotic theory.
"Approximate" -> idiosyncratic errors can be *weakly* correlated in time and cross-section.

When both N and T tends to inf., it is possible to estimate the loadings and factors simultaneously. 
When only T tends to inf., we estimate first the loadings and then the factors. Note that factor estimates are not consistent when N is fixed.

They don't prove anything. They only point to resources which does.

I have currently read upto page 108 (just before estimating the number of common factors). The rest of the articles is application, testing and non-stationary data. I don't think this material is relevant for my present research. I may still comeback to estimating the number of factors.
