[2003] - Bai - Inferential Theory for Factor Models of Large Dimensions

Derive the rate of convergence and the limiting distribution of the common factors, loadings and common components with the principal component estimator.
They consider N and T tending to inf.

"Classical" factor analysis : fixed N and only T tends to inf.

[Chamberlain and Rothschild] PCA asymptotically the same as FA when N tends to inf.

[Anderson 1984] Under classical factor models, one can consistently estimate factor loadings but not the factors.

When N and T tend to inf., we get consistent estimation even in the presence of serial correlation and heteroskedasticity.

The principal component estimator is the same as the non-linear least square with a constraint on the loadings (or factors)

They allow for non-stationarity in the data by allowing heteroskedasticity.
