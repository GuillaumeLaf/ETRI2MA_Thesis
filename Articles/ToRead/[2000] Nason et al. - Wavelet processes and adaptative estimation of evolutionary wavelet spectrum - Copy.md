[2000] Nason et al. - Wavelet processes and adaptative estimation of evolutionary wavelet spectrum - Copy

This is the main paper about the processes used to construct a factor model.

Generalize the Fourier representation of stationary stochastic processes to non-stationary ones. 
They characterize the autocovariance of the process via wavelets (similar to the spectrum representation in Fourier).

The second-order structure changes over time !
