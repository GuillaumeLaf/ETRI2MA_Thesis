[2000] Nason et al. - Wavelet processes and adaptative estimation of evolutionary wavelet spectrum - Copy

This is the main paper about the processes used to construct a factor model.

Generalize the Fourier representation of stationary stochastic processes to non-stationary ones. 
They characterize the autocovariance of the process via wavelets (similar to the spectrum representation in Fourier).

The second-order structure changes over time !

They propose a new process based on wavelets and constraint the model to be locally stationary via constraints on the model coefficients (and not on the covariances, as in Mallat et al. 1998).

They use non-decimated wavelets which are not orthogonal
