[1986] Connor and Korajczyk - Performance measurement with the arbitrage pricing theory.md

They construct estimators of portfolio performance using PCA.

They require an approximate factor structure. 
Their model assumes that a small number of investors have superior information ( samll relative to the overall number of investors and thus have no impact of the competitive price).

The returns of assets follow an approximate factor model.

This paper was not really of direct relevance fir my research since they only used the factor model to express the market behavior. 

I really read throught it quickly and did not looked at the proofs. 
One way my research could connect to this article is by assuming assets returns to follow a LSW process.
