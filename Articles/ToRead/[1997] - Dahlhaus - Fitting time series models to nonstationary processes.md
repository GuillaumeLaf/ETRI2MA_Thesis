[1993] - Dahlhaus - Fitting time series models to nonstationary processes

Final remark after 1st read : This article really focuses on estimation properties of models to non-stationary processes (proof : convergence of estimators, asymptotic normality).

This paper does not prove anything about why nonstationary processes makes sense. It does however provide a way to estimate them.
(see Section 3 : fitting parametric models to locally stationary processes).
The proofs and creation of those nonstationary process are given in other articles of Dahlhaus (1996).

"The assumption of stationarity is the basis for a general asymptotic theory, 
it guarantees that the increase of the sample size leads to more and more information of the same kind [...]".

Generalized method of Whittle for stationary processes (Whittle 1953).

He is only interested in "parameteric inference for nonstationary time series" -e.g. AR process with time-varying coeffs.
Study relation of his method to least-square estimates.

Major problem with nonstationary process = how to have an asymptotic reasoning ? 
(since "extending the process into the future will not give any info on the behavior of the process at the beginning of the interval").

AR process with time-varying coefficients are locally stationary (see Dahlhaus 1996).
