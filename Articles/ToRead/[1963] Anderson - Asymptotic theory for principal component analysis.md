[1963] Anderson - Asymptotic theory for principal component analysis.md

This paper gives the asymptotic distributions of the characteristic roots and (normalized) vectors of a sample covariance matrix (where obs follow a multivariate normal and roots have an arbitrary multiplicity).

The linear combination with normalized weights of a random vector which maximizes the variance of the obtained random variable is the first principal component. 
The second principal component is the same as the first one (max. var.) except that it is independent (orthogonal) to the first principal component.
