[1998] Morettin and Chang - Wavelet analysis for Time Series.md

 wavelet spectral analysis for stationary processes.
 
 This article review wavlet theory.
 
 Usually there are no analytical four for a wavalet we have to use the dilation equation.
 
 the spectrum of Fourier extarct information about the whole function. Altering slightly the function at  
 a particular time may have a tremendeous impact on the spectrum.
 
 The windowed fourier permits the analysis of a locally stationary function but it cannot deal well with detecting high and low frequency at the same time
 
 The wavelet coefficients for the Haar wavelet are simply a weigthed average of neighbouring observations. 
 
 The paper also review basic properties of the DWT ( asymptotic distribution,...)
 
 In the orthogonal case, the (raw) wavelet oerkodogram is an unbiaised estimator of the wavelet spectrum. However it is not  a consistent estimate !
