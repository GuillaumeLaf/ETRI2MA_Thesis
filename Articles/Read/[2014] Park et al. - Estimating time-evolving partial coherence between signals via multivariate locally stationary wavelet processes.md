[2014] Park et al. - Estimating time-evolving partial coherence between signals via multivariate locally stationary wavelet processes.md

They try to estimate a time-localied cross-dependence in a collection of non-stationary signals. 
They develop two measures : (partial) wavelet coherences which are (in)direct measures of dependence.

indirect measure : estimate the dependence between two signal after removing the linear effect of the other signals.

## Definiton
+ Coherence : (time-dependent) linear relationship between two signals -i.e. time-evolving squared cross-correlation between filtered signals.
+ Partial coherence : direct linear relationship between two signals

The heart of this article is really to try and understand the direct and indirect dependences between multivariate signals. 

They assume the transfer function matrix to have a lower-triangular form. The latter assumption allows an easier interpretation of the dependency structure.
The idiosyncratic components are assume uncorrelated through time and having an identity correlation matrix.

**Question : What would be the difference between encapsulating the cross-dependence of signals in the transfer function matrix and the idiosyncratic elements ?**
