# ETRI2MA_Thesis
This repository organizes my master's thesis in econometry. It constitutes a way of keeping track of my achievements and what needs to be done. 
I'll try to be as complete and explicit as I can be. I don't start from nowhere since I've already written a first document during my first year in the econometric master about the same topic : Factors Model based on the Locally Stationary Wavelet process. This repository will be subdivided into several sections : 
+ Scientific Articles with my personal comments on each of them : 
  + Read (contains articles that I have already read)
  + To Read  (contains articles that I have to ready next)

At the end of the year 2022, I should have a publishable scientific article about my topic.

# My Goals
I'll describe here my goals for this second year. This may change based on my findings and difficulties. I'll keep track of the modifications in separate documents. I believe that generalizing previous work on the LSW factor model is efficient way of getting published, I may certainly be wrong since I've never got any published yet.
